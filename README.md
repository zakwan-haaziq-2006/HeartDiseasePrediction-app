# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction App

This is a **Streamlit web application** that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user inputs.  
It uses a trained **Machine Learning model (Logistic Regression/Random Forest/etc.)** stored in `Model.pkl`.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Interactive **Streamlit UI**
- Auto-calculates **Maximum Heart Rate** (`220 - age`)
- Randomizes hidden values (e.g., ST Slope, Oldpeak) to simplify user input
- Provides an easy-to-use prediction interface
